# React Error #185 - Final Fix

## Problem
React error #185 occurs when trying to render objects as React children. In this app, the issue is caused by:

1. **session.settings** - This is a JSONB field from Supabase that contains an object like `{"grid_enabled":true,"student_can_draw":true}`
2. **session.password** - Might be an object in some cases
3. **Potential object rendering in various components**

## Solution

1. **Update sanitizers** - Already done in `/utils/supabase/helpers.ts`
2. **Add SafeRender component** - Already created in `/components/SafeRender.tsx`
3. **Fix specific issues**:
   - Ensure session.settings is never rendered directly
   - Convert any objects to strings before rendering
   - Add type guards for all dynamic content

## Files to check:
- ✅ app/page.tsx - Using sanitizeSessionData
- ✅ app/session/[id]/page.tsx - Using sanitizeSessionData
- ✅ components/ChatPanel.tsx - Using sanitizers
- ✅ components/SessionHeader.tsx - Using safeRender
- ✅ components/ParticipantsList.tsx - Type guards added

## Remaining Issues:
The error might still occur if:
1. There's a hidden object being rendered somewhere
2. A third-party library is causing the issue
3. Dynamic content from Supabase contains unexpected objects
